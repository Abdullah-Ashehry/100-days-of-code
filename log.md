### Day 1: Sept 12, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Built Chart Component, and linked the expense form to the main page.

**Thoughts**: Non Global Style is a bit difficult in React, but I managed to get through.


### Day 2: Sept 13, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Learned about CSS Modules, Component Styles, and scoping css variables. also built one more website scraper to add to the collection.

**Thoughts**: Best way to scope the css is definetly the Modules the other methods are not too scalable and they mess up the component code.



### Day 3: Sept 14, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Built a new basic project to using a different method to continue exploring React and sharpen my skills.

**Thoughts**: At this stage I have only worked with props, they work just fine but It comes an issue if you have many components, there's got to be an easier way than moving the data up two or three components and not be global scope.


### Day 4: Sept 15, Wedenesday

**Today's Progress**: Continued building and optimizing my scrapers with automated tests and bug detection.

**Thoughts**: Collection has begun for some of the scrapers towards my ML project, however I am a bit struglling with some of the scrapers due to firewalls on the websites and their lack of considering public API's.


### Day 5: Sept 16, Thurusday

**Today's Progress**: Researched capailities of potentially new system to implement, finished the API's of two more websites with their tests.

**Thoughts**: The two new websites I couldn't Include the pictures due they're indivisually seperated. so in order to acquire the pictures I m going to have to write a script to get their pictures indivisually which would take some computing that I currently can't spare.


### Day 6: Sept 17, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Continued Building the Frontend of a small project of mine using React.

**Thoughts**: Today I worked on Improving my codebase of React by refactoring using React Portals, Fragments and Ref's, In case of fragments they really help to reduce pressure on the DOM and remove redundant code as for Portals they just work on Improving your code as a developer.



### Day 7: Sept 18, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Learned about new React Hooks such as useEffect and useReducer.

**Thoughts**: Today I worked on Improving my codebase of React by refactoring using useReducer and useEffect, I am building two simple project one is already built using simple react states, and the other using more advanced react hooks.

------------------------------------------------------ End of week 1

### Day 8: Sept 19, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: The GDSC Finally got back to me about the landing page design starting to coming up with templates and testing them in React.

**Thoughts**: I have been trying to Implement as apple feature they use in their products on their website which is this sort of transation I am trying to Implement.


### Day 9: Sept 20, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the components for the structure of the page and found a template for the CSS to continue structuring the page.

**Thoughts**: I might have refactored the code too much, to the point it is harder to implement indivisual colors to the components by making all the colors styled from a main style page.


### Day 10: Sept 21, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Almost finished everyting in the project for the GDSC Including all the basic styling, the rest of the styling and content is up to the rest of the team members.

**Thoughts**: What really consumed my time was the logos, I need to improve my self in this area so I can grasp the fundementals of this area, Including Adobe photoshop and adobe illustrator.


### Day 11: Sept 22, Wedenesday

**Today's Progress**: Today's progress was kind of low, I spent most of time trying to recreate a bug I got on my found when I deployed the website, however I couldn't replicate the bug in the responsive view to see what's causing it, the team leader approved my design and the team suggested a few minor edits such as padding, margins and colors as expected.

**Thoughts**: I hate finding cross platform bugs, I am still not sure why I can't reproduce the bug in the PC so I can try to fix it.
