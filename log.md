### Day 1: Sept 12, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Built Chart Component, and linked the expense form to the main page.

**Thoughts**: Non Global Style is a bit difficult in React, but I managed to get through.


### Day 2: Sept 13, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Learned about CSS Modules, Component Styles, and scoping css variables. also built one more website scraper to add to the collection.

**Thoughts**: Best way to scope the css is definetly the Modules the other methods are not too scalable and they mess up the component code.
